# House Price Predictor Leaderboard

This is a Streamlit application designed to host a competition for predicting house prices. Participants upload their predictions, and the leaderboard shows their accuracy and ranking.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Deployment on Streamlit

To deploy the application on Streamlit, you will need to create a new app on the Streamlit sharing platform. You can do this by following the instructions [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/sharing.html).

Look at the Notion page for more details.
